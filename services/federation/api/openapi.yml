    description: |-
      An authorized service can use these endpoints to request external resources that are supplied in the URL query parameters.
      The request made to the proxy endpoint will be forwarded as seen to the external server, including all HTTP Headers and the request body.
      For known servers the proxy will also add authentification details to the request, so that the original service doesn't need to handle the authentification with possible multiple external resources.
      The response will be the proxied response from the external server.

      The idea is that a service can use external resource by only changing the url to the address of the federation service.
