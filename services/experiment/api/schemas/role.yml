      #There are however a few magic role names:
      #* **base**: The members of this group are essential for the experiment. Whenever the 
      #connection to any of these devices is lost, the experiment can't be continued. The base 
      #group is always instantiated at the beginning of an experiment, and can only be 
      #instantiated once.
      #* **user**: This role is used to collect all services used for user interaction. As a 
      #user is free to join / leave an experiment at any time, the experiment can not rely on 
      #these service connection been established. There also can be multiple connections of 
      #these type.
