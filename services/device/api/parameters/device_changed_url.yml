    **An URL that will be called once the device changes.**

    Once the device was given a changedUrl parameter the contained URL will be called every time a device is changed
    as long as every callback resolves with a successful status code.

    If the callback fails the url MIGHT not be called in the future.

    There can be multiple callbacks registered with the same device.
